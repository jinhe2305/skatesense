SkateSense React-Native Roadmap

FrontEnd
  - when a spot is created, scroll to that spot
  - Add ads
  - form validation
  - update CSS of 'SpotPage'
  - remove initial spot
  - load data on initial entering app
  - remove header animation on login and signup pages

Backend Stuff
  - cleanup backend api

Fix
  - "scrollToIndex should be used in conjunction with getItemLayout or onScrollToIndexFailed, otherwise there is no way to know the location of offscreen indices or handle failures."
  - Make 'add new spot' button disabled until spots have loaded.
  - Bookmarks on the map aren't getting updated correctly
  - fix when input box is focused on, show above keyboard
  - current location doesn't get new location. So if I move, clicking the 'getLocation'button
  	goes to the starting location
  - VirtualizedList: You have a large list that is slow to update - make sure your renderItem function renders components that follow React performance best practices like PureComponent, shouldComponentUpdate, etc.

suggestions
  - move photos down to see whole map. Add a little lever
  - add an overlay to what the buttons do.
